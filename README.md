# Python GUI Project: To do task manager

## Overview

Graphical User Interface also known as GUI(pronounced as gee-uu-eye) is a visual representation of interactive components of a computer program. 
GUI enables non-programmers to easily interact with computer programs with the use of interactive visual components such as buttons, toolbars, menus, textboxes, etc.

This project provides a graphical user interface that enables users to `add` new tasks, `edit` added tasks, `remove` tasks, and mark tasks as `completed`. 
The GUI consists of:
  * a root window container that holds all other GUI widgets/components.
  * Listboxes to display lists of `ongoing` tasks and `completed` tasks.
  * Functional buttons to enable users to interact with the essential features of the GUI.
 
## Getting started

Requires any version of Python, preferably Python 3. 

It also requires **playsound** python 3rd party module. To install this, within your terminal enter `pip install playsound`. 

Clone this repository unto your local device or download the zip of this repository, and unzip it in your local storage.

Run [main.py](/main.py) and this should automatically create the GUI window. 

GUI Shortcuts:
  * `Ctrl+W` to close GUI window.
  * `Ctrl+n` to add new task to list of ongoing tasks.
  * `Ctrl+Shift+d` to remove selected ongoing task.
